# Frame

## Inspiration

My idea comes from a documentary shared in my writing studio, which is about a famous photographer called Annie Leibovitz. When the interview progresses to the family part, the following paragraph impressed me a lot.

The concept "frame" she mentioned here contributed a lot to her future artistic work. So in this prototype, I want to explore the difference between the world we see through just eyes or a frame.

## Brainstorming

First I want to collect some examples we can see in daily life.

These are photos taken by Polaroid that I saw shared by others. They have their own frames.

![example1](example1.jpg)

This is an episode from “Millennium Actress”, in which the portrait of the heroine is framed exactly on the slate.

![example2](example2.jpg)

This is the classic episode from "The Legend of 1900". In this scene the heroine happened to appear in the box on the cabin. I think this gives the heroine a special beauty.

## Prototype

My prototype is mainly concentrate on comparison between same scene with frame and not with frame, so this is just about feel.
