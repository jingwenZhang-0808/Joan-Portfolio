# Frame

## Inspiration

My idea comes from a documentary shared in my writing studio, which is about a famous photographer called Annie Leibovitz. When the interview progresses to the family part, the following paragraph impressed me a lot.

The concept "frame" she mentioned here contributed a lot to her future artistic work. So in this prototype, I want to explore the difference between the world we see through just eyes or a frame.

## Brainstorming

First I want to collect some examples we can see in daily life.

## Prototype

My prototype is mainly concentrate on comparison between same scene with frame and not with frame, so this is just about feel.
