# Final Project Concept

## Concept 1

- Who: People who interested in Edgar Degas but have no artistic knowledge reserve
- What: Most exhibitions of plane artwork can only deepen people’s incomprehension of those painters and their works. 
- Why: Edgar Degas, who is just like many other famous artists, has a common feature in a series of work. So I think mainly presenting this core feature can have better effect. And also some parts that Edgar Degas left for audiences to imagine can be implement since outsiders have no idea imagine in what direction.
- How: The comparison of shadow and light is very huge and can be used to guide people attention. Adding a general background of this series works can also save as supplemented introduction and in which can have more space for interaction.
 
## Concept 2

- Who: Children
- What: Now most aquariums are neither a good place for educating and amusing children, nor a comfortable habitat for marine creatures live there.
- Why: According to stories shared by experienced divers, swimming together without any body touch is accepted by whales, dolphins and other fishes. And playing water with many plastic toys is a joyful memory shared by many people in their childhood.
- How: Children can use the way preferred by marine creatures to communicate them, like swimming together, playing water, using sound wave. We do not request them to do what human appreciate, like dolphin show, but get near to them.

## Concept 3

- Who: People with choice phobia.
- What: We are now in the era of material explosion, and almost everyone has much richer experience than the past. Perhaps we need an outside power to help reduce choices and set limitation.
- Why: The same thing, the one under frame seems to greater charm than one without frame. I think coincidence is one of the origins. This woman is so normal that might have many substitute in this world, but only she come to this place unconsciously.
- How: I have a different idea with the 7in7 version. The final work can be a moveable wall or a moveable room with adjustable frame, and audiences experience the feeling of only see the outside world with that window. 

## Concept 4

- Who: People who want designers to customize certain things for them
- What: Some elements are labeled as unique things, and then turn to overflow with the power of social network. We need more direct, first-hand feeling. 
- Why: Expressing out impression is not that easy since it is so abstract. What people need is a fixed algorithm, or to say, a fixed processing to help them extract out impression. Color matching is highly related to impression which I think is quite suitable here.
- How: I get my idea from a movie called “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind”, feeling derives from all items related. They are objective but also subjective. So extracting color from them.

## Concept 5

- Who: People who want to escape their identity and duty for a while
- What: Mental problem because fierce competition is a big social problem, which even leads to more and more suicide cases. At this time, short-term escape is not a manifestation of weakness, but an independent struggle
- Why: I have collected some words like “I want to be a cat”, “I want to be a tree”. Although these wishes are difficult to achieve, they are not greedy. And excessive life pressure is a problem that many people face, so it is easier to cause empathy
- How: I want to design a small space, with some auxiliary pops in it to help people have an identity he want. Other people who came here also reached a consensus to help him play this role.
